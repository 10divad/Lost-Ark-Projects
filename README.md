# Lost Ark
Random trackers and tools while also tracking my progress as a coder


## Lost Ark Rapport Tracker - WIP
Just a general tracker to see what each NPC gives in terms of rewards such as collectibles, cards, souls, etc. along with their location.

Form version 1:

Notes: New to excel but a very simple start. Uses 4 filters and assigned macros to form buttons (ActiveX too problematic) for the most notable rewards.

Possible (many) Improvements: Possible improvements include adding a better for flexible button with images, add more rapport items such as gold to the list

## Lost Ark Builder

A builder planned by me but a WiP. This build planner will be featured with more customization tools so that a THEORETICAL dps can be found based on all relevant stats in game (some may be excluded during early development). Since the data is not available online, alot of the data will be manually extracted via testing.
